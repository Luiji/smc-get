module SmcGet
  
  #This is the Console User Interface smc-get exposes. Each command
  #is represented by a class in the CUICommands module. Those classes
  #have three methods: ::help, which should return a summary on how to use
  #the command (NOT print it, that's done by an internal method), #parse,
  #which gets the command-line for the subcommand passed in form of an
  #array you should destructively (i.e. removing the elements) analyse, and
  ##execute which finally executes the command. You are free to print out
  #anything inside that method.
  #
  #Note that inside the #parse method you can set instance variables
  #as you would do for any normal class. You can then grep their values
  #inside the #execute method. Furthermore, if inside #parse you detect
  #an error in the commandline the user provided to you, raise the
  #CUI::InvalidCommandline exception with a meaningful message which will
  #then be presented to the user.
  #
  #The last thing one should do when adding a command, is to modify the
  #help message in the CUI::GENERAL_HELP constant to reflect the existance of
  #a new command.
  #
  #Internally the flow is as follows:
  #1. The user calls CUI#initialize with ARGV.
  #2. That method triggers CUI#parse_commandline and passes ARGV to it.
  #3. #parse_commandline analyses the array it receives and figures out
  #   what command class inside the CUICommands module to instantiate.
  #4. CUICommand::Command.new calls #parse on the instantiated Command
  #   object (this is a subclass of CUICommand::Command). Note that
  #   smc-get has not been set up for now, and calls to Package.new or
  #   the like will fail.
  #5. The user calls CUI#start.
  #6. #start looks into @command and invokes the #execute method on it.
  #7. #start shuts down the interpreter via #exit. If the command execution
  #   method returned an integer value, it is used as the exit status.
  #
  #Have a look at the existing commands to see how it works. Especially
  #+help+ is quite easy to understand, so begin there.
