USAGE: #$0 search [-a][-d][-D][-l][-L][-p][-t] QUERY

Searches the local or remote repository for packages. QUERY is assumed
to be a regular expression.

OPTIONS:
  -a\t--authors\tSearch the author list.
  -d\t--description\tSearch the package descriptions.
  -D\t--difficulty\tSearch the 'difficulty' fields.
  -l\t--only-local\tOnly search local packages. Default is to search remotely.
  -L\t--levels\tSearch for specific level names.
  -p\t--pkgname\tSearch the package files' names.
  -t\t--title\t\tSearch the packages' full titles.
  
  
If you don't specify which fields to use, --pkgname is assumed as it performs
best if used alone.
