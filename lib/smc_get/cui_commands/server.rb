    <<-EOF
USAGE: #{File.basename($0)} server [-p PORT] [DIRECTORY]

Starts a simple static file server you can use to connect to
with another instance of #{File.basename($0)}. Note that it uses
Ruby's WEBrick, which is known to not be suitable for production
environments, so don't use this command for anything else than
serving small more-or-less private SMC repositories. Have a look
at robust servers like apache or nginx for making it available to
the public.

If DIRECTORY is given, uses that directory for the server root
directory. Otherwise, uses the current working directory.

OPTIONS
-p PORT\t--port PORT\tListen on this port instead of the default 3000.
